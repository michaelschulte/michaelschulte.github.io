I am working at the Department of Consumer Behavior at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Before that I held positions at the Max-Planck-Institute for Human Development in Berlin, at various other academic institutions and in the food industry (look at your breakfast table â€“ the company I worked for is very likely present).
My main research interests are decision making, process tracing and food choice behavior. Within these lines of research I am developing my own  tools to study decision processes (WebDiP, Flashlight, The pyeTribe) and answer questions like: What  information  do consumers use when making food choices? or How do search processes in simple gamble decisions unfold?

Furthermore I am interested in online research and teaching methodology in class and via the Internet.
