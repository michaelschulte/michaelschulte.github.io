      <description>I am working at the Department of Consumer Behavior at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Before that I held positions at the Max-Planck-Institute for Human Development in Berlin, at various other academic institutions and in the food industry (look at your breakfast table â€“ the company I worked for is very likely present). My main research interests are decision making, process tracing and food choice behavior. Within these lines of research I am developing my own tools to study decision processes (WebDiP, Flashlight, The pyeTribe) and answer questions like: What information do consumers use when making food choices?</description>
