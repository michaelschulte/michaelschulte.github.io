      <description>I have been using LaTeX (with pdfTeX) for 20+ years now &amp;#8211; to be honest I never bothered to understand the differences between the different TeX engines &amp;#8211; here is an excellent article by Graham Douglas explaining the ins and outs of the TeX engine(s).
&amp;#8230; the article also features OverleafÂ a shared TeX environment &amp;#8230; sweet!</description>

      <description>They say about Sublime: &amp;#8220;The text editor you will fall in love with&amp;#8221;
hmm &amp;#8211; kind of did that.
One reason being that when codingÂ LaTeX in Sublime there is an awesome autocompletion feature:
Type &amp;#8216;enum&amp;#8217; and you get:

      <description>Is Psychology ready for reproducible research?
Today the typical research process in psychology looks generally like this: we collect data; analyze them in many ways; write a draft article based on some of the results; submit the draft to a journal; maybe produce a revision following the suggestions of the reviewers and editors; and hopefully live long enough to actually see it published. All of these steps are closed to the public except for the last one &amp;#8211; the publication of the (often substantially) revised version of the paper.</description>

      <description>http://docs.latexlab.org/docs
LaTeX and Google Docs together in one nice (free)application &amp;#8211; this is a brilliant idea, which gives you the power of LaTeX combined with the excellent collaboration possiblities of Google Docs &amp;#8211; if I would have a button it would say &amp;#8220;I like&amp;#8221; &amp;#8230;
Here is a screenshot from the project page &amp;#8211; with LaTeX code on one side and the final output on the other &amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Two things are often bothering when one starts to work with LaTeX: in text referencing of literature and Umlaute (for our German speaking friends) ****
Referencing: Here is a list of 5 types of in text referencing. To get them to work in a LaTeX file you need to define a referencing style in your document (in the example I use APA &amp;#8211; American Psychological Association), you can of course use any style you want!</description>
