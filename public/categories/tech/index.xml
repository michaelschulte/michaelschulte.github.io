LaTeX and Google Docs together in one nice (free)application &amp;#8211; this is a brilliant idea, which gives you the power of LaTeX combined with the excellent collaboration possiblities of Google Docs &amp;#8211; if I would have a button it would say &amp;#8220;I like&amp;#8221; &amp;#8230;
Here is a screenshot from the project page &amp;#8211; with LaTeX code on one side and the final output on the other &amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Jeroen Ooms did for R what Google did for editing documents online. He created several software packages that help running R with a nice frontend over the Internet.
I first learned about Jeroen&amp;#8217;s website through his implementation of ggplot2 &amp;#8211; this page is useful to generate graphs with the powerful ggplot2 package without R knowledge, however it is even more helpful to learn ggplot2 code with the View-code panel function which displays the underlying R code.</description>

      <description>Two things are often bothering when one starts to work with LaTeX: in text referencing of literature and Umlaute (for our German speaking friends) ****
Referencing: Here is a list of 5 types of in text referencing. To get them to work in a LaTeX file you need to define a referencing style in your document (in the example I use APA &amp;#8211; American Psychological Association), you can of course use any style you want!</description>

      <description>Here is the problem: I want to have a server (Apache, MySQL) on my local machine (for the current purpose it was a Windows machine) to do some developing, testing or a demo. Getting XAMPP at Sourceforge is straight forward, installing it works like a charm.

Hmmmm
Here are some steps that helped me:</description>
