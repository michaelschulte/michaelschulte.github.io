      <description>This syllabus of an (obviously) awesome class has a ton of good reads:
Everything is fucked: The&amp;nbsp;syllabus
by Sanjay Srivastava
I would have two additions:
 A multi lab replication project on ego-depletion (Hagger &amp;amp; Chatzisarantis, 2016) And the response from Roy Baumeister and Kathleen D. Vohs  It&amp;#8217;s a really good statement of how f&amp;#8230; up things are (in addition to all the other good examples above) &amp;#8230;

      <description>The New York Times published a nice overview of the work on decision making and ego depletion (often ego depletion is used as a synonym with resource depletion, which is somewhat confusing because of the use of the later in economy to described the situation when raw materials are exhausted in a region).
A new paper from Jonathan Levav (now at Standford &amp;#8211; congrats!) is prominently featured in the above article.</description>
