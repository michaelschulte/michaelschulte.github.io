Everything is fucked: The&amp;nbsp;syllabus
by Sanjay Srivastava
I would have two additions:
 A multi lab replication project on ego-depletion (Hagger &amp;amp; Chatzisarantis, 2016) And the response from Roy Baumeister and Kathleen D. Vohs  It&amp;#8217;s a really good statement of how f&amp;#8230; up things are (in addition to all the other good examples above) &amp;#8230;

      <description>I gave the R package exams a shot for my decision making lecture. Here is what it does:
&amp;#8220;Automatic generation of exams based on exercises in Sweave (R/LaTeX) or R/Markdown format, including multiple-choice questions and arithmetic problems. Exams can be produced in various formats, including PDF, HTML, Moodle XML, QTI 1.2 (for OLAT/OpenOLAT), QTI 2.1, ARSnova, and TCExam. In addition to fully customizable PDF exams, a standardized PDF format is provided that can be printed, scanned, and automatically evaluated.</description>
