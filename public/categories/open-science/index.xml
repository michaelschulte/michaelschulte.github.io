      <description>I wrote this letter to the black goat podcast &amp;#8230; will update here if I hear back from them &amp;#8230;
&amp;nbsp;
Dear goaters (is this a good way to address the three of you?),
   I attended SIPS some weeks ago (first timer). I was unsure what to expect but got a lot of bang for my buck (which is great) &amp;#8211; as a side note I would recommend first timers to try to go there with a concrete project or question or problem, I think there is a good chance to find people with similar issues interested in collaborations.</description>
